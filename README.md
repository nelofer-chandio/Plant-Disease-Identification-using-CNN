Plant Disease Identification Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is a deep learning-based project designed to automatically detect and classify plant diseases from leaf images. The system helps farmers and agricultural experts identify plant diseases at an early stage, improving crop management and reducing losses.

This project uses image processing and deep learning techniques to build a reliable and efficient disease classification model.
